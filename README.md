# Amazement
This is a simple 3d mobile horror game that involves navigating procedurally generated mazes to escape a monster.
I developed this game for the Georgia State Technology competition in the Game Development category, and this game won top 3 in all of Georgia.
I developed a maze generating feauture which makes every replay different.  You must also hide from a giant spider scorpion monster that lurks within the maze itself. I developed the music, sprites, scripts, and sounds myself over the span of a few months.
